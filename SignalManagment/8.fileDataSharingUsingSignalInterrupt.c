/*
Write a Program - parent has to get the data from user and store the data in file. After that parent process will send one signal to child process. child process after receiving the
Signal ,open the file and convert data to opposite case and store again in same file.

Hint : Use pause() Â¡n child process.
Use signal num 10(userSignal) in parent.


NOTE-
1) open file locally(inside each process) and use system calls to do file operation
2) globally opening file will be sharing file discriptor betwenn process(unlike varibales, where duplicate copies were ensured by copy-on-write mechanism), and use lseek() to reset file discriptor whenever needed
3) file operation using library functions is complicated, while dealing with parent-child, as every time, buffer need to be flushed- fflush(),
