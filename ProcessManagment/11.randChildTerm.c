/*
Write a program to create a three child process â€˜from the common parent use random delay between 1 to 10 sec in each child. Use the exit value in such a manner so that parent should know the sequence of the child exits.
Hint : while(wait(&status) != -1)
	{
	;
	}


in short - program to create 3 child process with common parent , use rand life upto 10 sec for each child, 
and from common parent know which child is exiting
	ie not to print from child after exiting child but,
	collect status from child, and from parent print which child is terminated
